- Three different types of list: ordered list, unordered list and description list.
  - Unordered list is used when the order doesn't matter that much
  - Ordered list is used when the order does matter
  - Description list is used for associating a list of terms with decriptions of those terms, just like the name: Description.
- Lists are also used as navigation menus.
